# email-filter
A small program to simulate 'filtering' out emails that are known to already be from spam senders as part of my data structures course

This code will not run without ourvector.h, but I have not included it as that is Univeristy of Illinois at Chicago property, and I am not allowed to post it on github.

This program features my own binary search algorithm and multiple file loading/string parsing operations.
